## servcli

A brief description of your application

### Synopsis

 This application provides a user-friendly command line interface that allows users to view and browse a list
  of available servers. Users will be able to specify criteria such as geographic location, availability, processing
  capacity, current load, or any other attribute relevant to their specific environment.

  Through a combination of intuitive commands and advanced filters, users will be able to quickly narrow down the list
  of available servers to their specific needs. Once the server is selected, actions such as SSH connection, remote
  command execution or resource management can be performed easily.
